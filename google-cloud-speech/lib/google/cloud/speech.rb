    # Google Cloud Speech API enables developers to convert audio to text by
    # applying powerful neural network models in an easy to use API. The API
    # recognizes over 80 languages and variants, to support your global user
    # base. You can transcribe the text of users dictating to an application's
    # microphone, enable command-and-control through voice, or transcribe audio
    # files, among many other use cases. Recognize audio uploaded in the
    # request, and integrate with your audio storage on Google Cloud Storage, by
    # using the same technology Google uses to power its own products.
