- **If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work**, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom). After that, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

## Coding Style

Please follow the established coding style in the library. The style is is largely based on [The Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) with a few exceptions based on seattle-style:

* Avoid parenthesis when possible, including in method definitions.
* Always use double quotes strings. ([Option B](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#strings))

You can check your code against these rules by running Rubocop like so:

```sh
$ rake rubocop
```
